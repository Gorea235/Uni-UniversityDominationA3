# University Domination - Assessment 3

This is team Starmix's repository for assessment 3. Project page can be found [here](https://starmix.devsprime.com/Projects/3). The page also has all the documentation and a link to all the builds.

Some folders in the Assets folder have their own READMEs in order to further explain how that section works and give an overview on the reason and structure of that asset.

We have also provided a Builder class that enables building for all available platforms. This script can be run on the commandline via the `build.cmd` batch file on Windows, or via calling `make` on macOS. A Linux build script has not been provided, however it would be simple to make by modifying the existing scripts.
